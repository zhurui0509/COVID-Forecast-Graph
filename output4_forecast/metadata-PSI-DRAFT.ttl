    covid:modelBrief "'A stochastic/deterministic, single-population SEIRX model that stratifies  by both age distribution and disease severity and includes generic intervention  fitting. '" ;
    covid:modelDesc "\"Deterministic fit of a compartmental SEIRX model to cumulative death  profiles, followed by stochastic simulations using the optimal parameters. All compartments  are stratified by age. 'I' compartments are additionally divided by disease severity  into Asymptomatic, Mild, Flu-like, and Severe.  Severe disease is defined by the  need for an ICU bed. Interventions are fit generically to an n-value smooth function.  Forward  projections are conditional on interventions/reproductive number remaining unchanged.\\n Updates:\\n July 20 - model is fit using MCMC procedure\\n August 10 - R(t) is fit using n=3, 4, and 5 values. The n-value resulting in the lowest AICc score is used for the forecast.\"" ;
