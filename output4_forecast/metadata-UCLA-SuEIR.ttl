    covid:modelBrief "The SuEIR model is a variant of the SEIR model considering both untested  and unreported cases. The model considers reopening and assumes susceptible population  will increase after the reopen." ;
    covid:modelDesc "\"We update our model by considering the effects of reopenings. In particular,\\  \\ for the states that have reopened or partially reopened, we assume there is a\\  \\ transition from a virtual  \\u201CQuarantined/Isolated\\u201D group to the \\u201C\\  Susceptible\\u201D group at a certain rate after the reopen date. This rate along\\  \\ with other model parameters are jointly estimated based on the reported data.\\  \\ The key feature of the SuEIR model is that it can infer the untested cases as\\  \\ well as unreported cases. More specifically, we treat the \\u201CExposed\\u201D\\  \\ group in the SEIR model as the individuals that have already been infected and\\  \\ have not been tested, which are also capable of infecting the \\u201CSusceptible\\u201D\\  \\ group. Moreover, some of the people in the \\u201CExposed\\u201D group can get tested\\  \\ and transferred to the \\u201CInfectious\\u201D group (which are reported to the\\  \\ public), while the rest of them will recover/die and transit to the so-called\\  \\ \\u201CUnreported Recovered\\u201D group (which are not reported to the public).\\  \\ More detailed model descriptions and projections can be found at https://covid19.uclaml.org.\\n\\  Reference: Difan Zou, Lingxiao Wang, Pan Xu, Jinghui Chen, Weitong Zhang and Quanquan\\  \\ Gu, Epidemic Model Guided Machine Learning for COVID-19 Forecasts in the United\\  \\ States, medRxiv:2020.05.24.20111989, 2020.\"" ;
