    covid:modelDesc "\"We break down the SEIR model into 7 compartments:  Susceptible individuals\\  \\ (S),  Exposed individuals (E),  Contagious individuals who are asymptomatic or\\  \\ mildly symptomatic (C),  Infected with moderate or non-severe symptoms (I_N),\\  \\  Infected with severe symptoms (I_S),  Recovered (R) and Deaths (D). \\nWe fit\\  \\ our model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method in each county\\  \\ to estimate  the parameters set (alpha, beta, mu, h, gamma, theta, delta...).\\  \\ We start with the initial parameters set  from other studies and iterate the set\\  \\ in the model by calculating and comparing the likelihood values between  the real\\  \\ cases and projected cases, finally we get our best projected curve (with 95% confidence\\  \\ interval) which  has minimum sum of squared residuals (SSR).\"" ;
