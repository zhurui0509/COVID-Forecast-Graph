    covid:modelBrief "The ERDC SEIR model makes predictions of several variables (e.g., reported  new/cumulative cases  per day, etc.). Model parameters are estimated using historical  data using Bayesian inference." ;
    covid:modelDesc "'The ERDC SEIR model is a process-based model that mathematically describes  the virus  dynamics in a population center (e.g., state, CBSA) using assumptions  that are common  in compartmental models: (i)   modeled populations are large enough  that fluctuations in the disease  states grow slower than averages (i.e., coefficient  of variation < 1) (ii)  recovered individuals are neither infectious nor become  susceptible to  further infection." ;
