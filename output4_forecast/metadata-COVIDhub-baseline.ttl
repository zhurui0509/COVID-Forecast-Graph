    covid:modelBrief "This model is a baseline predictive model." ;
    covid:modelDesc "'For predictions of incidence, the median prediction at all future horizons  is the most recent observed incidence.  Predictions of cumulative counts are derived  from predictions of incidence; this means that the slope of the predictive medians  for cumulative quantities from one week to the next will be constant and equal to  the last observed slope.  To get a distribution around the median, we look at how  much incidence has changed from week to week in the past, and we allow for the possibility  that similar changes will occur again in the future." ;
