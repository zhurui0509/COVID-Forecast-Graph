    covid:modelBrief "A metapopulation county-level SEIR model for projecting future COVID-19 incidence  and deaths. This forecast is the scenario we believe to be most plausible given  the current setting." ;
    covid:modelDesc "'This metapopulation county-level SEIR model makes projections of future  COVID-19 incidence and deaths.  We produce a number of different intervention scenarios,  each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the  future.  This submission is the selection of the weekly scenario we believe to be  most plausible given current observations and planned intervention policies.  The  selected scenarios are listed below:   November 12 - present ''5_2xbeta'': 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week, the reproduction  number R is set to 1.  November 8 - November 11 ''5_2xhold'': This scenario  assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week,  the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.    October 4 - November 5 ''5_1xhold'': This scenario assumes a one-time 5% increase in contact rates, which is applied at the start of the projection and maintained for one week.  After one week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.  June 14 - September 27 ''5_2xhold'': This scenario  assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week,  the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.   June  7 ''80contact1x5p'' : This scenario assumes a weekly 20% decrease in counties with  growing weekly cases and stay-at-home orders in place, and a one-time 5% increase  in states that have reopened. May 7 - June 4 ''80contactw5p'': For states maintaining  or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions  of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a  weekly 5% increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. May 3 ''80contact1x10p'':  For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we  apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in  states that reopen, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during  the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate  for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26 ''70contact'': This scenario  mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g.  school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation  (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections,  all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction.  Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact  rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had  previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number  of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 30% contact  rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario.
