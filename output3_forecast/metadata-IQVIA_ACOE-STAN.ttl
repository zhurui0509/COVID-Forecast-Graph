    covid:modelBrief "Spatio-Temporal Attention Network" ;
    covid:modelDesc "We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for state-level pandemic prediction.  Our method aims at addressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic outbreak  predictions by (1) using patients EHR data from different states that encode local disease  status and medical resource utilization condition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical  proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep learning models.  STAN uses an attention-based graph convolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and  predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a physical  law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction." ;
