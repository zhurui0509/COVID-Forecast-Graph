The modeling approach in this  study is divided into four components:  (i) identification and processing of COVID-19  data;  (ii) statistical model estimation for population death rates as a function  of time  since the death rate exceeds a threshold in a location;  (iii) predicting  time to exceed a given population death threshold in states early in the pandemic;  and  (iv) modeling health service utilization as a function of deaths.\" CurveFit  package available at: https://github.com/ihmeuw-msca/CurveFit'" ;
