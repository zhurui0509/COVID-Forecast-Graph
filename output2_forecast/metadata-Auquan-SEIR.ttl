    covid:modelBrief "Modified SEIR model with compartments for reported and unreported infections.  Non-linear mixed effects curve-fitting." ;
    covid:modelDesc "We start with a standard SEIR model and break down the Infectious compartment(I)  into reported infections (Ir) and unreported infections (Iu). People from the Exposed  compartment(E) with symptoms go into the reported infections (Ir) compartment. People  with mild or no symptoms go into the unreported infections compartment. Both reported  infections (Ir) and unreported infections (Iu) contribute to disease spread, but  at different rates - a low spread for people quarantined in compartment Ir, and  a high spread for, often, asymptomatic people in compartment Iu. This handles the  quarantine measures taken by countries to limit the infections. Some people in reported  infections (Iu) recover (compartment C) and some die (compartment D) All people  in unreported infections (Iu) recover (compartment Cu), there are no mortalities  in this compartment. If their symptoms were serious enough they would be reported  (and therefore in compartment Ir). We fit our model to reported confirmed cases  and reported deaths in a region to estimate beta1 and beta2 for that region. For  other parameters, we use estimates from other studies as starting point and learn  using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between projected daily  deaths and reported daily deaths." ;
