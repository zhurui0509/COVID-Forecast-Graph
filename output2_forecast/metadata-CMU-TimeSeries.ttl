    covid:modelDesc "\"State level - A basic AR-type time series model fit using lagged values of case   \\ counts and deaths as features. No assumptions are made regarding reopening or governmental\\  \\ interventions. The model is jointly fit across all 50 US states, after some time-alignment\\  \\ is performed as a preprocessing step to facilitate comparison between states. Heavier\\  \\ weight is placed on more recent training data, to account for nonstationarity in the\\  \\ underlying process. A lasso penalty is added to induce variable selection and prevent\\  \\ overfitting. Quantiles are computed using a residual (Gaussian) bootstrap, separately for\\  \\ each location.\\  \\ County level - A quantile regression model fit jointly across selected counties using (1) \\  \\ case counts, (2) self-reported COVID symptom rates, (3) doctor's visits rates related to \\  \\ COVID symptoms, and (4) county population.  Features (1-3) are taken at various lags. \\  \\ Furthermore, the slopes of features (1-3) are computed over the preceding month and \\  \\ included in the model to provide a sense of the virus's momentum.  Signals (2-3) are \\  \\ available as indicators through Delphi COVIDcast (http://covidcast.cmu.edu). Signal (2) \\  \\ is administered with the support of Facebook. No assumptions are made regarding reopening \\  \\ or governmental interventions.\"" ;
