    covid:modelBrief "County-level, state-level, and national-level SEIR model projections for daily incident confirmed COVID   cases by using AI to fit actual cases observed." ;
    covid:modelDesc "\"IEM is currently using an AI model to fit data from various sources \\  \\ and project new cases of COVID-19. We do not assume the average number of secondary \\  \\ infections (R-value) stays the same over time. Our model makes projections for \\  \\ over 375 individual counties in the U.S., all 50 states, the District of Columbia, \\  \\ and 3 U.S. territories. For each jurisdiction, our model runs 4 million simulations \\  \\ to find the best R value that would allow the SEIR model to fit the data for confirmed \\  \\ cases. Our model assumes that the R value changes quite rapidly over time due to changes \\  \\ in human behavior. Our model uses a sliding window to fit the data and find the best \\  \\ R values for each of the windows. Projections of future cases assume that human behavior \\  \\ and social distancing measures are unchanged.\"" ;
