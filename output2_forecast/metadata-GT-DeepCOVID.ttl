    covid:modelBrief "'Data-driven approach based on deep learning for forecasting mortality and  hospitalizations  using syndromic, clinical, demographic, and mobility. '" ;
    covid:modelDesc "May 11 - This data-driven deep learning model learns the dependence  of hospitalization and mortality rate on various detailed syndromic, demographic,  mobility and clinical data (such as increase in positive Covid tests etc) from historical  data. The learned model is then used to predict mortality and hospitalization at  various points in future. To compensate for the effects of noise (in data and initialization),  the model is bootstrapped on several subsamples and then aggregated. The model also  propagates uncertainties in the data to show the confidence intervals in the forecasts." ;
