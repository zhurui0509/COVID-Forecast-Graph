    covid:modelBrief "Multiple skewed gaussian distribution peaks fit to raw data" ;
    covid:modelDesc "The existing case and death raw data is cleaned slightly for anomolies,  then is fit with model consisting of one or more skewed gaussian distributions using  a distribution model I developed.  The model estimates the height, position, and  spread of each peak that appears in the data and can be used to project ahead with  reasonable results. This is an emperical approach that makes no epidemiological  assumptions but simply fits the existing data as well as possible. The model assumes  that the effects of current interventions are reflected in the observed data and  that those effects will continue going forward." ;
