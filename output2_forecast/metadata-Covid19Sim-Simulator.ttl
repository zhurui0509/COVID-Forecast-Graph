    covid:modelBrief "An interactive tool developed by researchers at Mass General Hospital, Harvard  Medical School, Georgia Tech and Boston Medical Center to inform COVID-19 intervention  policy decisions in the US." ;
    covid:modelDesc "'The COVID-19 Simulator uses a validated compartment model to simulate  the trajectory of COVID-19 at the state level from March 15, 2020 to August 31,  2020 in the United States. Utilizing the most recent data for each state, the COVID-19  Simulator considers state-specific disease spread dynamics. Specifically, to reproduce  the observed trends and project future cases of COVID-19, time-varying and state-specific  effective reproductive numbers are estimated and fed as inputs into a compartment  model. The compartment model is defined using Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious,  and Recovered compartments (i.e., SEIR model) with continuous time progression.  Model programming and analysis were performed in R (version 3.6.2), and the package  deSolve was used to solve the ordinary differential equation system. '" ;
