    covid:modelDesc "A non-mechanistic, non-parametric model for prediction which forecasts  time series as a sum of bell curves. Confidence intervals are provided by assuming  a multiplicative log-Gaussian perturbation on the observed time series. While the   curve-fitting approach is based on a parsimonious function class, we also note that  it arises as a simple outcome of an SIR-like process in a network setting, allowing  the parameters of the fitted curve to contain structural meaning." ;
