    covid:modelDesc "The Political Realities Model (PRM) is built on observations of macro-level  societal and political responses to COVID19 characterized only in terms of infections  and deaths. The starting point of the model is the hypothesis that although individuals  and policy makers have responded to the epidemic with a wide variety of behavioral  modifications and policy actions, the actual net impact of the measures taken, though  not identical across time or geography, is predictable. Moreover, these predictions  can be based upon what a society and its elected officials have demonstrated it  (they) will accept as a reasonable aggregate impact from COVID19. This model seeks  to identify one or more \"acceptability\" range(s) from observation of the epidemic  up to the current time and to understand how much impact on infection rates is achieved  by responses in this (these) range(s). Deaths, in turn, are related to infections  via a simple (time- and geographically-varying) phenomenological model derived through  fitting. This allows the model to build in spatiotemporal variation in the demographics  of the population, its access to health care & COVID testing, and the actual infection  fatality rate without explicitly considering these factors. At present the model  is deterministic rather than probabilistic, and so only provides point forecasts.  The model considers the United States at the state level." ;
