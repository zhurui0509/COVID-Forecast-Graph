    covid:modelBrief "This is an ensemble of nine models that are identical except that they are  driven by different mobility indices from Apple and Google. The model underlying  each is a deterministic, SEIR-like model." ;
    covid:modelDesc "This forecast is an ensemble of nine models that are identical except  that they are driven by different mobility indices from Apple and Google. The model  underlying each is a deterministic, SEIR-like model. Model simulations are initiated  by imported infections, which arrive from January 1 onward according to a scaled  Normal probability density. Each imported and then local infection gives rise to  an average number of secondary infections distributed forward in time according  to a generation interval distribution. Once infected, a proportion of those infected  die at times distributed according to a distribution between symptom onset and death.  Testing of a subset of symptomatic infections is distributed in time in a similar  manner, and the model is fitted to data on test positivity by accounting for those  seeking testing and a differential probabililty of seeking testing conditional on  one's infection status. The model is simultaneously fitted to deaths according to  a Poisson likelihood of daily incidence of death. There are a total of twelve model  parameters that are all estimated. First, a parameter sweep is conducted to identify  the parameter combination from the sweep with the highest likelihood. Then, a region  around that parameter combination is assumed to have a uniform prior, and a posterior  set of parameters is obtained with MCMC. The model is then simulated forward under  each sampled parameter set from the posterior distribution. This process is repeated  for each of nine mobility metrics from Apple and Google for 50 states and some territories  where at least one type of mobility data is available. Simulations from the posterior  predictive distribution of each model are pooled evenly and used to generate a probabilistic  forecast in each state and at the national level." ;
