    covid:modelBrief "Projects infections and deaths for 223 locations using an SIR model." ;
    covid:modelDesc "\"On our website we present daily projections for\\  \\ infections and deaths for 108 countries, 52 US states/territories,\\   \\ and 63 US counties.\\  \\ For the US we calculate mortality rates by US region and time\\  \\ based on the ages of people infected in a given region.\\  \\ We provide the following data as a function of time and place:\\  \\ cumulative and daily confirmed cases, cumulative and daily deaths,\\  \\ confirmed case-based and death-based effective transmission ratios,\\  \\ fraction of populations infected and constant infections transmission ratio,\\  \\ probability of Covid-19 contact,\\  \\ mortality and undercount, and fraction of positive tests.\\  \\ Our projections are driven by the effective transmission ratio, Rt.\\  \\ More specifically we run an SIR model using deaths and another using cases\\  \\ resulting in Rt for deaths and Rt for cases.\\  \\ To forecast how Rt will change with time, we analyze Rt change data through\\  \\ the course of the pandemic and apply a model of that characteristic behavior\\  \\ to forecast infections and deaths.\\  \\ UPDATE 20-10-18: Changed Rt forecast from Rt for deaths to the average of\\  \\ Rt for deaths and Rt for cases.\\  \\ UPDATE 20-10-25: Changed from Sunday forecast to the average of\\  \\ Friday, Saturday and Sunday forecasts.\\  \\ UPDATE 20-11-08: Corrected undercount calculation approach\\  \\ resulting in an increase in forecasted cases.\\  \\ UPDATE 20-11-29: Adjusted the 20-11-29 forecast by hand in light of\\  \\ under-reporting over the Thanksgiving holiday week.\\  \\ UPDATE 20-12-06: Cleaned up and enhanced a number of things in the RtDriven code.\\  \\ These changes are tracking internally as RtDiven 2.0.\"" ;
