    covid:modelBrief "A mobility-informed simplified SIR model motivated by collision theory." ;
    covid:modelDesc "\"We incorporate mobility information into a simplified SIR model which\\  \\ has an analytical solution with only two fitting parameters. Without any social-\\  \\ distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well \\  \\ for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite \\  \\ different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning. \\  \\ We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling \\  \\ exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative \\  \\ mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative \\  \\ mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties. \\  \\ In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest \\  \\ of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain \\  \\ meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above, \\  \\ fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date. \\  \\ The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories: \\  \\ retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in \\  \\ our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error \\  \\ analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting \\  \\ error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated \\  \\ based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast has been \\  \\ included for 32 states. Other states and county-level forecast will be included later.\\  \\ Starting Nov 29th, we included a summer reduction of 10% from 06/01 to 09/01 and an \\  \\ election mobility increase of 25% from 09/01 to 11/03. The summer reduction of mobility \\  \\ accounts for elevated outdoor activities while election mobility increase accounts for \\  \\ large gatherings of political rally which maybe washed out in the averaged state-mobility. \\  \\ We assume 80% of the vulnerable population will be vaccinated within three months. \\  \\ The assumption is antibody will fully emerge after 2 weeks upon the 2nd shot. \\  \\ To account for the recent mutations, we increases the infection rate by 20%. \\  \\ Two vaccination scenarios have been considered and predicted which are shown in our website. \\  \\ Google mobility data may have been affected by a recent Sep update. \" " ;
