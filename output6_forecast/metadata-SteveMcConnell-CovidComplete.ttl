    covid:modelBrief "National level and state level, near-term (1-4 week) fatality forecasts." ;
    covid:modelDesc "\"This is a near-term fatality prediction model that calculates and\\  \\ uses fatality trends at the national and state level, trends in positive virus\\  \\ tests and total virus tests, and age-related demographics for state forecasts.\\n\\  Model forecasts are based on predicting near-term deaths from recent positive virus\\  \\ tests and recent deaths. The model assumes average delays of 14-21 days from positive test to death.\\  \\ The specific model chosen varies state by state and is selected based on the historical accuracy of each method \\  \\ in each state and/or the historical accuracy of the error-corrected version of each method.\\  \\ No assumptions are made about the effectiveness of interventions or treatments;\\  \\ the model assumes that any such change in effectiveness will be included implicitly\\  \\ in the historical fatality data and the fatality rates calculated from that data.\\  \\ This model uses a Rational Actor assumption for week 4, in which states that \\  \\ have death rates below their historical averages remain flat and states that have \\  \\ death rates above their historical averages revert toward their averages. \\  \\ No assumptions are made regarding specifics of reopenings or specific governmental interventions.\"" ;
