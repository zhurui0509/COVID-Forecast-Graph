    covid:modelDesc "\"Our forecasts are based on the reported numbers of cases and  deaths at the country or regional level. Our modeling substantially relies on  estimation of the underlying trend by a robust LOESS seasonal-trend  decomposition model, which allows to account for non-stationary weekly  seasonality, outliers, missing data and delayed reports. To further predict  daily cases and deaths we use linear extrapolation of the estimated smooth  trend either on the original or on the logarithmic scale.\"" ;
