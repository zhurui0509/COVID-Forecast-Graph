    covid:modelBrief "FRED is an agent-based model developed for influenza with parameters modified  to represent the natural history of COVID-19" ;
    covid:modelDesc "\"We used an existing agent-based model, FRED (Framework for Reconstructing\\  \\ Epidemic Dynamics) which was developed by the university of Pittsburgh in response\\  \\ to the 2009 influenza pandemic (Grefenstette et al. 2013). We modified the model\\  \\ parameters to represent the natural history of COVID-19 and calibrated a set of\\  \\ parameters to reproduce current trends of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. FRED\\  \\ simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among\\  \\ people on a daily basis. To accurately represent the population of each of the\\  \\ states simulated, we used a synthetic population of the US that represents demographic\\  \\ and geographic characteristics of the population in 2010 (Wheaton 2012). Each\\  \\ human is modeled as an agent that visits a set of places defined by their activity\\  \\ space. This activity space contains places such as households, schools, workplaces,\\  \\ or neighborhood locations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected\\  \\ person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers\\  \\ of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts\\  \\ do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents\\  \\ have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not\\  \\ stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are\\  \\ included in the model to represent the changes in agents\\u2019 behavior in response\\  \\ to an epidemic.  In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure\\  \\ and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level\\  \\ guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray\\  \\ 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space\\  \\ to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce\\  \\ each agent\\u2019s activity space to their household at a compliance level from\\  \\ 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration. Agents who do not\\  \\ comply with the shelter-in-place orders continue with their daily routines. We\\  \\ used state-level orders to determine the date at which people are advised to shelter\\  \\ in place (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray\\  \\ 2020).  See the methods file in our repo for more detailed methods and model limitations.\\n\\  Updates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching\\  \\ from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater\\  \\ over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate\\  \\ the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use\\  \\ the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively\\  \\ use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys\\  \\ made to residential locations. We calibrate the maximum compliance to shelter\\  \\ in place, and use a generalized additive model fitted to the google data to forecast\\  \\ movement in the coming 5 weeks. For more details on this approach, see the methods\\  \\ file in our repo.\"" ;
